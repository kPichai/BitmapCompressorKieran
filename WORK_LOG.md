The most obvious one seemed to be doing something like if you see XXXXX then changing that to 5X. This could be done with ones and zeroes such that if you have 00000000 that turns into 0\1000 (1 or 0/number of repetitions). |

Thus I allocated a 2nd bit up front on our byte that indicates whether this data is being comrpessed or not. I essentially coded this part of the pest by reading in boolean by boolean (bit by bit) then keeping track of a count of how many consecutive runs of a single bit you are on. If your count ends before 7 (where you dont want to compress bc then you will actually increase total data size) then you use the method above with an additional bit up front indicating whether the following bits is a compressed sequence or not. Otherwise, you loop until you hit the maximum of 2^6-1 then write the compressed byte to the output file. This code ensures that we have enough information to losslessly expand the compressed file later on. |
