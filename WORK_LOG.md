The most obvious one seemed to be doing something like if you see XXXXX then changing that to 5X. This could be done with ones and zeroes such that if you have 00000000 that turns into 0\1000 (1 or 0/number of repetitions). |

Thus I allocated a 2nd bit up front on our byte that indicates whether this data is being comrpessed or not. I essentially coded this part of the pest by reading in boolean by boolean (bit by bit) then keeping track of a count of how many consecutive runs of a single bit you are on. If your count ends before 7 (where you dont want to compress bc then you will actually increase total data size) then you use the method above with an additional bit up front indicating whether the following bits is a compressed sequence or not. Otherwise, you loop until you hit the maximum of 2^6-1 then write the compressed byte to the output file. This code ensures that we have enough information to losslessly expand the compressed file later on. |

This is why when I tested my code my compressed file had 0 bits. I then fixed this small issue and tested it on both q32x48 and q64x96 test cases. For the smaller one I acheieved a compression ratio of 67%, for the medium test case I achieved a compression ratio of 38%. This isn't near a 30% compression ratio yet so I have to think about a more efficient way to create this code such that I can compress better. |
| Nov 20 | 10:55am - 11:55am | During this session (during class), I talked to Mr. Blick about my solution and figured out ways to address glaring issues. One issue I was having was that when I expanded my function I always ended up with less bits then I had started with. This is partially due to a few issues: what I chose to compress and not compress, and how I handled edge cases. My original failure was that I only compressed things that had repeats of longer than 6. However, I had to change this to longer than repeats of 8 because this is the correct way to consider the case (I only ever compress anything to one bit). Additionally, I was only ever reading in byte by byte which meant that I could have some extra padded 0s at the end. One way me and Mr. Blick suggested fixing that with is I could write a 3 bit "char" to the top of the file each time which indicates how many padded / ignored 0's there should be at the end. This would help remove the edge case and could also ensure we read in the right amount of bits each time. |

I also coded expand however I am having lots of issues with expanding the file as I seem to just hugely multiply the size of the file compared to the original when I expand. |

After fixing this my expansion algorithm got a lot closer to the expected values across the board yet was still messing up when it comes too size because now it is undershooting slightly as opposed to overshooting a lot. Next, I will work on troubleshooting my compression algorithm as mistakes in that might also lead to my expansion not getting the info it needs. |

I got lost in this long rabbit hole of issues and decided that I simply just need too restart, I my compress code and re wrote it from scratch. I tested it and each time I was undershooting my compression by a little bit (when expanding again on mystery.bin i would end up with 7760 bits instead of 8000 for example). |

This could mean that I hadn't expanded correctly simply because I didn't have the necessary information. |

Things I have tried: printing out maxBits and see if its being read incorrectly (though I dont think it is because different maxBit values lead to different compression ratios which makes sense), trying to flush the BinaryStdOut writer, etc. |
